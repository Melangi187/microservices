Implement JWT based authentication and autherization.

Create a new authentication API endpoint
Examine every incoming request for valid JWT and authorize

Reference: 

1. Create a project with following dependencies
	Spring web and 
	Spring security

2. Create an endpoint
	e.g. HelloWorldController class
	The /hello url here is not accessible to customers.
	Since we have added a security dependency, this service is behind an authentication wall.
	So we cannot access it.
	
3. Let's do simple authentication to access this api.

	Create a WebSecurityConfig  (in SpringSecurityJwtApplication.java) extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

	

	a. EnableWebSecurity by adding @EnableWebSecurity
	
	b. Have an instance of class implementing UserDetailsService.
	
	So create a new class implementing  UserDetailsService
		UserDetailsService has
			loadUserByUsername
			Takes userName as input
			return User object with username and pwd if there is a User with this userName.
			It not throw an Exception
	Mark it as a Service.
	
	Autowire it into WebSecurityConfig
	
	b. Define the password encoding 
		
	
	
	
	
	Spring security requires an implementation of the following classes 
		UserDetails
		UserDetailsService
		
	Spring sercurity from a security point of view is interested to know the following
		What are his 
			authorities, 
			roles,
			username 
			pwd
			expired/active ect.
			
		We can store more information.
		We need to map Our UserDetail to our model.User class.
		A best option is Decorator pattern
		 
		
JWT (JSON web token)

4. Add the following dependencies
		jjwt (Java json web token)
		jaxb-api library.
			There are few jaxb dependencies we need in both java 8 or otherwise.
			
	
5. 	Create a class called JwtUtil
	Refer to the JwtUtil.java.
		Given a username, it can generate a token.
		Latter it can validate the username.
		
6. 	Create an end point for creating this jwt.
	

	
Client is going to keep this token and send it in future in the request header.
We should retrieve the token from header. Validate the token. If valid, is that in the security context as the currently logged in user.

7. Create models.AuthenticationRequest.java
		This is the class where we will take the request. So
		username and password
		With getters and setters for them.
		Have a constructor with no args
		

8. Create a models.AuthenticationResponse.
		This should return a jwt token. So
		Constructor with (jwt)
		getter for jwt.
		
9. In the Controller, create a new post end point
	/authenticate 
	This uses the spring's AuthenticationManager.authenticate method.
		This will get the UserDetail object from UserDetailsService
		Spring's default validation works.
			Is username and pwd same in our case.
		If this fails, then throw and Exception.
	
	If validation passes, then 
		generate the token.
		Return a ResponseEntity with token in it.
		
	Reference: HelloWorldController.createAuthenticationToken method
	
	
	Question: Why is this a POST method?


Need to tell spring
Intercept all incoming requests
Extract jwt from the header
Validate and set in execution context saying that this is a valid user. Let's allow him.

10. Create class filters.JwtRequestFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter
	
	Implement doFilterInternal(req, res, FilterChain)
		FilterChain: Option of passing to the next filter chain or are we ending the request.
	
	Logic 
		Get the Authorization header.
		Check if it starts with Bearer
		Extract the jwt token from it.
		Using the jjwt api, extract the user name from it.
		Load the user based on username.
	
		If username is not null and something has not already went into the security context. If something is already there then we don't need to check. Already the authentication is over.
		
		load the userDetail based on the username
		validate the token passing the jwt token and username to it.
		
			If validation is successful.
				Since Spring security internally uses UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken, we are creating the same. 
				for managing authentication in the context of username and pwd.
				
				Set this to the request object.
				
				Above is what generally Spring security do to allow each request to go through after username and pwd matches.
	 
		chain.doFilter: Continue with the normal operation (request object has the validation response).
		
Now we need to tell the SecurityConfigurer to use our new filter.
	Don't bother creating a session. We will do it.
	
11. Add the configure method in WebSecurityConfig
			httpSecurity.csrf().disable()
				.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/authenticate").permitAll().
						anyRequest().authenticated().and().
						exceptionHandling().and().sessionManagement()
				.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
		httpSecurity.addFilterBefore(jwtRequestFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
	Disable csrf.
	Permit all requests coming with "/authenticate"
	For others don't create session.
	We will add session by httpSecurity.addFilterBefore
		
12. 
	a. Make the following request		
	http://localhost:8080/authenticate
	Request type: POST.
	header 
		Content-Type - json
	body
		{
			"username": "vilas",
			"password": "vilas"
		}
	
	This returns a jwt token.
	
	b. Make the following request.	
	http://localhost:8080/hello
	header
		Key: Authorization
		Value: Bearer<space><jwt>
