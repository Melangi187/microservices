Create the project in Eclipse
Open Eclipse STS.
Right click on the project panel (or go on Menu > File) then New > Spring Starter Project.
Fill the following fields in the form:
	Name: the eclipse project name (e.g. “spring-boot-myfirst”).
	Group: a group name for your projects (e.g. “learn”).
	Artifact: the name of the jar file (e.g. “spring-boot-myfirst”).
	Description: a brief human readable description (e.g. “Spring Boot base Web Application”).
	Package name: the java root package name (e.g. “learn”).

Note: Group and Artifact are from Maven, and here there is a brief explanation if you want to follow their conventions: http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html.

Click Next. Search and select the “Web” dependency, then click Finish.
Will be downloaded a basic project template from the Spring web site.
