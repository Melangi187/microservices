We are going to add our first RestController.

1. Create a POJO in the same package (or below) XXXXApplication.java
	
2. Annotate it as @RestController
	This makes it a RestController
	
	Question: What is a Controller in mvc?
	
3. Add a new method with following details
	name: that you like
	annotate: @RequestMapping
	return: what you like.
	
	@RequestMapping("hello")
	public String doSomething(){
		return "Hello World!!!";
	}
	
4. Execute this and verify the message on the screen.

Question: What type of HTTP request was that?
		How did Spring boot know and map it or is it not required for it know?

N.B: Internally Spring web uses spring-webmvc.
	This gives Controller support.
	
	How did the response got converted to html?
	@RestController mapping
		embeds the response from the method in the http response object and returns back.
