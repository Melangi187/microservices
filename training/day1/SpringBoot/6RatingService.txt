Implement Rating Service
------------------------


Create a Spring Boot application with following dependencies
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		
		
Kindly refer to the rating-service and implement the same.
	I am returning a hardcoded rating of Rating 5 for every Employees.
		Want to improve the logic go ahead.
