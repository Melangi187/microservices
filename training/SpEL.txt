	All spring expression should be declared inside
		${} or #{}
	Any bean can be directly accessed using the id attribute of the bean
	Members and methods of a bean are accessed using the dot "." notation.

	Matching regular expression: use matches keyword.
	Regular expression syntax is similar to java
	Individual elements in list can be accessed using []
	Filter operations on elements in a list
