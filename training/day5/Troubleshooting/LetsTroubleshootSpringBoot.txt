3. Web server failed to start. Port 8080 was already in use.
	You probably forgot to stop and kill previous web server.
	Terminate it.
	
	If you want to start the server on a different port, then define "server.port" in the application.properties and retry.
	




General troubleshooting guidelines
----------------------------------
Following questions would be great to think about:
- Did you try the debugging taught in the class?
- Were you able to identify which line of Front code is throwing this error?
- Are you having the same problem with other requests? Or is it just this request you are facing a problem with?
- Was there a HTTP Call going to backend?
- Do you see other errors in console?
- Can you log all the things from the frontend - Can you enable debug logging and monitor the messages in the console on the server side? It should give you a clue. For doing this set the following in application.properties and restart the server.
	logging.level.org.springframework = debug

- In jwt is the Authorization header value right? `Bearer ${data.token}` for JWT and 'Basic ' + window.btoa(username + ':' + password) for Basic Authentication.


3. Fix proxy issue in Maven
	Add proxy in 
	$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml

	Further details in the documentation below
	http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html


4. For STS extract
	Always use "Extract here" and not "Extract All"
		"Extract All" can run into path issues.
		
5. To update Maven repo.
	Right click on project -> Maven -> Update project
	
6. Spring 2.4.3 was not resolving properly
	Trying moving to spring 2.4.2
	
7. Unable to resolve a file.
	Spring STS usually shows this error when the set up isn't correct.

	Go to the line containing the error
	Click on the alert bulb so that it can suggest possible fixes
	From the options, choose the "Fix project setup"
	Follow the rest so that the project then re-aligns the import order.
	
8. If STS is not showing method/attribute help

	Try 'Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced'.

9. While adding Eureka or any other jar if (intellisense) java help is not available,
	then go to properties of service and in "Java Build Patha" - libraries 
		verify if the jar is linked.
		is the jar really present
		compare with other folders to understand it better.
		
	If the files is not present then mvn code can be seen and if required jar can be downloaded from 
	https://mvnrepository.com/

for e.g.  		
	https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server/3.0.1
