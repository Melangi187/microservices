General troubleshooting guidelines
----------------------------------
Following questions would be great to think about:
- Did you try the debugging taught in the class?
- Were you able to identify which line of Front code is throwing this error?
- Are you having the same problem with other requests? Or is it just this request you are facing a problem with?
- Was there a HTTP Call going to backend?
- Do you see other errors in console?
- Can you log all the things from the frontend - Can you enable debug logging and monitor the messages in the console on the server side? It should give you a clue. For doing this set the following in application.properties and restart the server.
	logging.level.org.springframework = debug

- In jwt is the Authorization header value right? `Bearer ${data.token}` for JWT and 'Basic ' + window.btoa(username + ':' + password) for Basic Authentication.
